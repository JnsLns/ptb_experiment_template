# Folder `template`

Holds all template/experiment code: The code defining the experiment itself, files that generate a trial list, and a pre-existing folder to store results in.

Initially there is example code in the folders that together implements a simple "experiment". When implementing you own experiment, go into the files, delete the example code, and write your own.
