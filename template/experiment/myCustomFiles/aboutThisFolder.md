# Folder `myCustomFiles`

This folder is meant to place any files or functions in it that you want to use or call in your experimental code. The folder and any subdirectories are added to the MATLAB path when the experiment is run through `runExperiment.m` or `resumeExperiment.m` and is removed afterwards.
