% This is the place to show stuff to participants before the experiment
% starts, such as instructional text.
%
% The window pointer for the onscreen window is 'winOn.h'. You can draw
% directly to it and/or copy some offscreen window to it, like this:
%
% Screen('CopyWindow', winsOff.someWindow.h, winOn.h);
% Screen('Flip', winOn.h); % present what was drawn
%
% Note: You can also use the custom convenience function ShowTextAndWait
% (in folder 'helperFunctions/miscellaneous') to show centered text and
% wait for a button press before proceeding.
