# Folder `myParadigmDefinition`

The script files in this folder should contain the code that defines you experiment. When `experiment/runExperiment.m` or `experiment/resumeExperiment.m` is exectued, these files are executed in the order of their numbering (with some stuff happening in between under the hood). Step 5 (s5...) files are part of the trial loop and are executed each trial in the order indicated by the lettering. 

The files are completely empty at first save for example code that you may delete and documentation of what to do in each file. You need to write code for each step.
