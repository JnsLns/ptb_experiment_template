%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NECESSARY CHANGES TO ANALYSIS SCRIPT

% Aborted trials are now stored, i.e., there are now empty trajectory
% matrices in e.trajectories and partially incomplete results rows (nans).
% This has to be dealt with during analysis.

% the triallist is not longer stored in the experimental output. everything
% needed can now be found in e.results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% GENERAL TODO %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Check color representation... 0-1 or 0-255 ? See PsychDefaultSetup doc
% and check all color specifications in the code. I might have mixed the
% two...

% IMPORTANT: Test storeResults.m

% Make a setting (in trial generation) to determine whether trials should
% be repeated if aborted. Maybe with maximum number of repetitions.

% Make similar scheme for trajCols as for resCols? (would simplify dealing
% with different dimensionality of trajectories...)

% Any pseudo-randomization in terms of trial order has to be done when
% constructing the triallists... (i.e., outside the experiment script)

% Enable multisampling for onscreen window (does it have to be enabled for
% offscreen windows separately?), like this (here, 20 samples are used):
% w =  PsychImaging('openWindow', 0, [0 0 0], [100 100 500 500], [], [], [], 20);

% Pointer calibration... validate it in some way before proceeding.

% The checks for starting position being assumed and held throughout
% fixation phase may (didn't test) need some sluggishness over time to not
% be disrupted by marker jumps. on the other hand, bad data should be
% filtered out anyway and replaced by last good data, so that should do the
% trick unless there are types of marker jumps that are not caught by this.
