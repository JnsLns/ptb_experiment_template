% Draw graphics that remain unchanged over trials to offscreen windows.
% Use the window pointers stored in struct 'winsOff.myWindow.h'.
% The coordinate frame for drawing is of course the Psychtoolbox frame,
% units are pixels. Use functions 'vaToPx' and 'paVaToPtbPx' to convert
% from visual angle to that frame. See folder 'common_functions' for these
% functions documentations and other conversion functions you may use.
